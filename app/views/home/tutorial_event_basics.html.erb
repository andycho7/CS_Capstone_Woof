            <h3>Creating/Viewing/Editing events</h3>
            There are two ways you can post an event.
            You can right mouse click anywhere on the map which then calculates the most probable address. The user needs to select what kind of event they want to post and fill in the information.

        <p>    
            The user can click on the button of the event type they prefer. These buttons are in a menu below the map. This menu is accessible when blue button is clicked. From this menu, user can filter events based on their choice.
            After the event type is selected, they then fill in the required details for the event.
